## Notes About Usage
- We can run this project with the help of "docker-compose up" command. To do so, we need to ad .env files.
In order to handle this problem I want to add .env files to repo in this situation.
- After project up, we can see in localhost react js frontend website. It has a homepage as you described in frontend part.
- When it comes to backend, (localhost:8000) I have created this with the help of Django Framework. As you want I created only an endpoint which is named 'api/save_company_name'. This endpoint can be reached everywhere outside app.
- There is also another page in backend,(localhost:8000) this is a name changer page, it will help to change company name with ajax query. 
- That is all.
